                About the My Father  
            </h1>  
            <br><br>
<p>  
               My father is the best and the most hardworking person I have ever witnessed in my life. He is the man that has been with me on the worst days. He is the man who used to leave me in front of the school gate when I was just a kid. He used to console me when I used to cry before going to school.
<br><br>
               He runs a business. He is a successful man but he never realizes that. He tries to improve every single day for the sake of giving a better life to his family. He is never satisfied with himself and thinks that everything could have been better, but never realizes what he has given to us is the best. His efforts are what that matters.
<br><br>
               He had a childhood with a lot of hardships but neither he has given up nor he has taught me to. He has taught me to win. He has taught me to be honest. He has taught me some biggest life lessons.
<br><br>
               He is the man I look up to every day.
